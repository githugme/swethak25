we are just two cats in love and no one will ever truly understand what we have, just meow meow with me till we can meow meow..

the cute little things from you really warm my heart, so I have made something little from what I can to warm yours.. (hopefully)

The sun is like a billion kms away and theres like tons of stars and planets yet he never stopped kissing you ever since the day you stepped foot in the green planet, you are gods favourite + Im gonna throw arms at him cuz you are mine.

Ive been with you for more than 3 years now and all I know is your family loves you more than anything, the cute tantrums and dramas are just still adorable and painful proofs that family lookout for each other. you've made everyone smile alone at night with what you achieved, I bet they are grateful for you, Swetha. 
and Im not saying this cuz you completed the finals, just the person you are cuz YOU ARE AN ANGEL.

Happy Birthday K Swetha, wish we could go back to LEO. in our uniform (I am not wearing shoes) so I can grab your chocolate , give you a shake hand and enjoy that second of feeling a girl of my dreams.

You are the bravest as it gets, if it was the medieval period, Jhansi rani woulda hired you like damn. you just packed your suitcase , went to the north, got past tough times, cooked, cleaned, prepared, all alone and CLEARED one of the toughest exams to crack?? There is nothing you cannot do my lady and the years are gonna get easier, better and sweeter.
